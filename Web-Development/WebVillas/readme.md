# WebVillas - Semester Project
#### WebVillas is a FullStack Website for me to familirize myself in basic Web Development tools. WebVillas uses Html, Css, JS in frontend and PHP, MySql in backend.
#### WebVillas was created in my 5th semester of my studies for my project semester in course 'Web Development' and it was my first encounter with web programming, tools, developing etc..
